- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vexotex
- 👀 I’m interested in technical stuff. I'm a mechanical engineer and love to build things. I have a 3D-Printer and came in contact with Github through some more advanced projekts like the "dactyl manuform"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "programming" in general. I'm new, to this topic and want to learn as much as possible, because i think it is very interesting and am pretty facinated by the sheer amount of possibiltys it will open
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my first "ERP-Projekt", but "collaboration" is an overstatment. First i need help to understand the basics and would love to share that experience with someone else
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: i learned spanisch for a 2 week vacation and will probably never use it again
